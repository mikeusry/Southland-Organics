INSTALLATION
==================
Enable the 'administer calais marmoset' permission for roles at 
'admin/user/permissions'

Then add your settings at 'admin/settings/calais_marmoset'.  You might need to 
obtain an API key from http://opencalais.com/APIKey

SETUP PAGE.TPL.PHP
==================
On your page.tpl.php file, add

<?php
  if(module_exists('calais_marmoset'))
    require_once (CALAISMF_INCLUDE_DIR . "header.php");
?>

before the doctype declaration.

And after the closing html tag add


<?php
  if(module_exists('calais_marmoset'))
    require_once (constant("CALAISMF_INCLUDE_DIR") . "footer.php"); 
?>

NOTES
==================
To see the crawler output, take any URL on your site and add 
'?overrideUserAgent=true' to the end of it.  You will then see the a series of tags that
are injected onto the page.  The base URL for these tags is set by "Tag Base URL" 
setting.

For the Marmoset view to be useful, you should install the opencalais module so your
content is tagged with taxonomy terms.
