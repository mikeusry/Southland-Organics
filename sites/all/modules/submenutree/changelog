Submenu Tree


=======
6.x-1.3

Added new feature: Extended primary links block. 

The Extended primary links block extends the primary links menu into a block. 

In other words, the Extended primary links block selects the menu designated as the primary links menu and displays the rest of that menu (ie. from the second or third level downwards) in a block. 

If no primary links menu exist, it will use the secondary links menu if that exists.
